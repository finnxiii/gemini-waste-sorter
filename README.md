## 🚀 Features

- 📸 Image capture using ESP32-CAM
- 🧠 AI-based waste classification via Google Gemini Vision API
- 🤖 Sorting control with Arduino Uno R4 WiFi
- 🌐 Offline functionality via local Wi-Fi hotspot
- ♻️ Separates recyclable, compostable, and landfill items

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Hardware:** Arduino Uno R4 WiFi, ESP32-CAM  
- **Software:** Python, Google Gemini API  
- **Networking:** Local Wi-Fi hotspot  
- **Tools:** Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, VS Code

## 📸 How It Works

1. ESP32-CAM captures an image of the trash.
2. Image is sent to a Python script that queries Google Gemini’s Vision model.
3. Based on the classification result, Arduino directs trash to the correct bin.
4. System works over a local hotspot, enabling semi-offline use.
